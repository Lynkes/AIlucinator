@book{Norman13,
  abstract = {Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out
	which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push,
	pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book,
	lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs
	of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems
	range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships
	between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or
	other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The book
	shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple:
	make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function
	and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide
	the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at
	the right time.},
